# 👋 Hey! I'm Pablo Reina

## 🚀 Data Engineer focused on cloud, modeling, and automation

I'm passionate about building data platforms that actually *work* — clean architectures, scalable pipelines, and fast answers. My sweet spot? Dimensional modeling, orchestration with **Prefect** and **Airflow**, and dbt-powered transformations that keep things modular and maintainable.

I mostly work in the cloud (think **AWS** and **GCP**), designing robust ETL/ELT workflows and warehouse architectures that teams can rely on.

### 🧠 I care about:
- Turning raw data into clear decisions
- Elegant code that performs
- Automating the boring stuff (because... life’s too short)

## 🛠 Tech I use a lot

### Data Engineering & Cloud
- **ETL/ELT**: dbt, Prefect, Airflow
- **Cloud Platforms**: GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow), AWS (Redshift, S3, Lambda, EC2)
- **Data Modeling**: Star schemas, snowflake schemas, versioned & auditable layers

### Programming & Processing
- **Python** (all day, every day)
- **Advanced SQL**
- **PySpark** for distributed data wrangling

### Analytics & Viz
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **SciPy**
- Ready to plug into any BI tool

### Bonus Skills (because why not?)
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework, Firebase and Supabase
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind
- **Mobile**: Flutter + Clean Architecture
